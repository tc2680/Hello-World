According to a UN [study][link-un], water scarcity is both a natural and a human-made phenomenon. We may have enough freshwater on the planet for seven billion people but it is distributed unevenly and may be polluted in many regions.

While doing research for blog post #3, I came across a report from the [Circle of Blue][link-water] about the survey for price of water. This report provides a comparison of water rates in 30 U.S. cities and shows readers a sense of comparsion result in following infographic.

There is also a survey table available in pdf format.

### Practice 
Instead of a plain survey with a small simple bar chart, the goal of this blog post is to find a better way to tell the price of water story. Since the data set is based on cities, I think it can be a good start to try Geo Map which we have seen some great examples throughout the class. Next, I revised the bar chart to show water price for all cities for the category "Average Monthly Bill for Family of Four Using 50 gallons/person/day". The interactive map may take few seconds to load up by clicking image below. You can scroll down to see the revised bar chart. Coincidentally top 3 city names with highest water price all start with "S" - San Diego, Santa Fe, and Seattle.

Last but not least, from knowing nothing to producing three blog posts and a project, the EDAV opens up many ideas and possibilities for my study and work. After three months of learning, the biggest change to me is - today when I look at any article, I always try to picture how to visualize the message and seek a better way to tell the story. That's it.
