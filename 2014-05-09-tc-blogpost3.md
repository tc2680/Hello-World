According to a UN [study][link-un], water scarcity is both a natural and a human-made phenomenon. We may have enough freshwater on the planet for seven billion people but it is distributed unevenly and may be polluted in many regions.

While doing research for blog post #3, I came across a report from the [Circle of Blue][link-water] about the survey for price of water. This report provides a comparison of water rates in 30 U.S. cities and shows readers a sense of comparsion result in following infographic.

There is also a survey table available in pdf format.

Since the data set is based on cities, I think it can be a good practice to try Geo Map which we have seen some great examples throughout the class.
