<table width="700" align="center"><tr><td>
<p>According to a <a href="http://www.un.org/waterforlifedecade/scarcity.shtml">UN study</a>, water scarcity is both a natural and a human-made phenomenon. We may have enough freshwater on the planet for seven billion people but it is distributed unevenly and may be polluted in many regions.</p>

<p>While doing research for blog post #3, I came across a report from the <a href="http://www.circleofblue.org/waternews/2010/world/the-price-of-water-a-comparison-of-water-rates-usage-in-30-u-s-cities/">Circle of Blue</a> about the survey for price of water. This report provides a comparison of water rates in 30 U.S. cities and shows readers a sense of comparsion result in following infographic. </p>

<p>There is also a survey table available in pdf format. </p>

<h3>Practice</h3>

<p>Instead of a plain survey with a small simple bar chart, the goal of this blog post is to find a better way to tell the price of water story. Since the data set is based on cities, I think it can be a good start to try Geo Map which we have seen some great examples throughout the class. Next, I revised the bar chart to show water price for all cities for the category "Average Monthly Bill for Family of Four Using 50 gallons/person/day". The interactive map may take few seconds to load up by clicking image below. You can scroll down to see the revised bar chart. Coincidentally top 3 city names with highest water price all start with "S" - San Diego, Santa Fe, and Seattle.

<p>Last but not least, from knowing nothing to producing three blog posts and a project, the EDAV opens up many ideas and possibilities for my study and work. After three months of learning, the biggest change to me is - today when I look at any article, I always try to picture how to visualize the message and seek a better way to tell the story. That's it.</p>
